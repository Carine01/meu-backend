# Placeholder patch for agent workflows
# This is an optional patch file for GitHub Actions workflow configurations.
# 
# To use this patch:
# 1. Add your workflow changes using git diff
# 2. Save the diff output to this file
# 3. The automation script will apply it automatically
#
# If you don't need workflow patches, the script will safely skip this step.
